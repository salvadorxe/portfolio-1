  title: Research Insights
  description: Conversations and insights from participants revealed an opportunity to reimagine the clarity and organization of personal-professional network management.
  steps:
    - Primary users are young professionals who have several networks spread across different applications.
    - Professionals struggle with communication. Focus on interaction history may help address this.
    - People feel that they lack the necessary structure needed to maintain relationships.

  title: Testing insights
  description: Participant walkthroughs of an early prototype influenced changes to key frames and interaction flows.
  steps:
    - quote: "I enjoy the visualization of my groups...but the layout does not feel as organized. Too many contacts may become overwhelming"
      designChange: Revise structure of communities on home page and make affordances clearer to execute.
      images:
        - ./images/user1.png
    - quote: "I can find relevant contact information and visiting contact pages seems useful. Scheduling reminders feels burdensome"
      designChange: Emphasized user actions specific to networking. Simplified drafting and scheduling experience.

        - ./images/user2.png
    - quote: "Can a contact belong to more than one group? I would want a flexible way to import specific contacts or add entirely new ones"
      designChange: Improve flow of contact import and creation. Show associations to groups more clearly.

conclusion:
  title: Conclusion
  description: More testing will help determine the usefulness of our design solution
  steps:
    - subheading: Spend less time designing.
      text: The design solution leverages familiar networking app interfaces, integrating user research to create a tailored contact-relationship management system.
    - subheading: Focus on meaningful use-cases.
      text: Our design focuses on simplicity and purpose, avoiding feature overload to prevent delays and ensure a more useful solution, centered on real user interactions and scenarios.
    - subheading: Test smaller and more often.
      text: Designing many frames concurrently in the mid-fidelity phase led to information overload. Testing smaller and more frequently ensures features are useful and enhance the experience.
